# Optimizing Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using Artificial Intelligence #PFE25-R-641  

AI based FEA prediction  

Despite the widespread adoption of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools in engineering, existing solutions face significant limitations that hinder efficiency, accessibility, and scalability. High computational demands, complex and error-prone data input processes, and the need for specialized expertise make traditional FEA workflows slow, costly, and inaccessible to many users. They include
-Computational Intensity
-Data Input Challenges
-Expertise Barrier
-Scalability and Cost
-Limited Real-Time capabilities
-Integration with Emerging Technologies

Aim: Develop an AI model trained on historical FEA simulation data to predict solid-state properties, reducing computational time and resource demands.
Objectives: Collect and preprocess relevant environmental and structural data
-Develop and train predictive machine learning models
-Create a visualization dashboard for decision support
-Validate results with real-world or simulated scenarios.
-Collaborate with researchers to analyse and validate results
